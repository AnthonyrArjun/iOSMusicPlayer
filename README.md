# iOSMusicPlayer

This app was built in Swift as a simple music player app. There are 3 genres of music you can choose from: Rock, Pop, and Hip-Hop. 

Once a genre has been chosen by the user, the app will tap into the users iTunes library if available, and shuffle through all songs listed in the selected genre
